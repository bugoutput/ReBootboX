## ReBootBox (RBX) is a Kludge to Remotely Power-Cycle Seismic Stations Using RT130 Dataloggers/Sierra 3G Modems

Currently the RBX is purpose-built for Anne Sheehan et al.'s [Weld County Seismic Experiment](https://cires.colorado.edu/news/preventing-human-caused-earthquakes) to save us from having to drive four hours round-trip just to power-cycle our stations whenever there's a telemetry dropout. 

The [User Guide](https://github.com/bugoutput/ReBootboX/master/userguidev0.pdf) contains a basic overview of the RBX system and how to talk to it over your 3G modem's serial port. 

In the near future I'll add a BoM and the Arduino source code. The unit cost for the device as shown is $30 sourcing all parts from Amazon Prime.
